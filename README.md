# 🌍 Blockchain Web3 Domain - Decentralized Key Recovery System

## 🚀 Overview
**Blockchain Web3 Domain** is a decentralized **key recovery system** that helps users recover lost private keys in a secure and trustless way using **guardian-based approval mechanisms**.  

### 🔥 Why This Project?  
Traditional wallet recovery methods are centralized and prone to **security risks** (e.g., lost seed phrases). Our system leverages **smart contracts** and **Web3 authentication** to provide a **decentralized and user-controlled** key recovery process.

## 🏗 How I Built This Project

### **1️⃣ Planning the System Architecture**
Before coding, I designed a **secure and efficient workflow**:
- Users **set guardians** (trusted addresses)  
- If a private key is lost, they **request recovery**  
- Guardians **approve the request** via smart contract  
- Once a **majority approves**, access is reassigned  

### **2️⃣ Developing the Smart Contract**
I wrote a **Solidity** smart contract with key functions:  
```solidity
function addGuardian(address _guardian) public;
function initiateRecovery() public;
function approveRecovery(address _user) public;
function finalizeRecovery() public;
